# roleplay-game-python

Description:
Roleplay/text-based game implemented in python. Has a total of three battles with progressively 
more challenging foes, plus sarcastic dialog and a plot-twist to knock you socks off. Game is the main
file, but there are two supporting classes - Character and Item - that enable code functionality.
Game also includes a number of functions that are used intermittently throughout the code to keep
things moderately legible. Just run it and have fun!

Usage:
Clone repository or download files from git. Via local terminal, navigate to containing folder and type:

$ python3 Game.py

Once run, the game will start automatically. Once you win or are killed, the program will exit.

Roadmap:
As of now, I would like to maybe implement a GUI for the game. I've never made a python GUI and it
would be a fun challenge. I think I might also include a jupyter notebook version for in browser access.

Project Status:
As of now, this phase of the project is complete. Any additional functionality will be added when I
feel like it. Which will probably be never.
